### Convert scss to css

##### Install sass
```gem install sass```
If you're using Windows, you may need to install Ruby first.

##### Run Sass from the command line, just use
 ```sass styles.scss styles.css```

##### Watch the file
You can also tell Sass to watch the file and update the CSS every time the Sass file changes:

```sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css```
